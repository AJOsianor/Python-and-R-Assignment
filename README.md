# Python-and-R-Assignment

Payment Slips Generation Project

This project includes Python and R scripts for generating payment slips for workers and assigning employee levels based on salary and gender conditions.

Python Script Instructions
1. Description: The Python script `payment_slips.py` generates payment slips for workers and assigns employee levels based on specified conditions.
2. Dependencies: This script requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system.
3. Usage:
   - Run the Python script by executing `python payment_slips.py`.
   - It will generate payment slips for workers and display their salaries, names, and assigned employee levels.
   - Any errors encountered during the processing of worker information will be handled gracefully.

R Script Instructions
1. Description: The R script `payment_slips.R` generates payment slips for workers and assigns employee levels based on salary and gender conditions.
2. Dependencies: This script requires the `dplyr` library in R.
3. Usage:
   - Ensure you have R installed on your system along with the `dplyr` library.
   - Run the R script in your R environment or RStudio.
   - It will generate payment slips for workers and assign employee levels based on salary and gender conditions.
   - Errors encountered during the processing of worker information will be caught and handled using `tryCatch`.
