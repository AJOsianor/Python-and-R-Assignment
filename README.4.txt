
A. Data Cleaning Tool

This tool provides functionality to address missing values in a dataset using various data cleaning techniques.

B. Getting Started

To use this tool, follow the instructions below:

C. Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pandas library

4. Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-cleaning-tool.git
    

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    bash
    cd data-cleaning-tool
    
3. Install the required Python packages:

    bash
    pip install pandas
    

5. Usage

1. Place your dataset file (in CSV format) with missing values in the project directory.
2. Update the `data_cleaning.py` file with the correct file name.
3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python data_cleaning.py
    ```

4. The script will handle missing values in the dataset using imputation techniques and generate a cleaned dataset file.

6 Customization

- You can customize the imputation technique used in the script by modifying the `handle_missing_values()` function in `data_cleaning.py`.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific data cleaning requirements.

7 Sample Dataset
